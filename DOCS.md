## Installation
1. **Upload Plugin Files**: Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/headless-access-manager` directory.
2. **Install via WordPress**: Alternatively, install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen.
3. **Activate Plugin**: Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
4. **Configure Settings**: Configure the plugin settings under the 'HAM' menu in the WordPress admin.
5. **Setup Data Structure**: Set up your schools, classes, and users as needed.

## Usage
### Setting Up Data Structure
1. **Create Schools**: Create schools via HAM > Schools.
2. **Create Classes**: Create classes and assign them to schools via HAM > Classes.
3. **Create Users**: Create users with appropriate roles (Student, Teacher, Principal, School Head).
4. **Assign Users**: Assign users to schools and classes via user profile settings.

### API Endpoints
The plugin creates multiple REST API endpoints:
- **Authentication**: `/wp-json/ham/v1/auth/token`
- **Users**: `/wp-json/ham/v1/users`
- **Schools**: `/wp-json/ham/v1/schools`
- **Classes**: `/wp-json/ham/v1/classes`
- **Assessments**: `/wp-json/ham/v1/assessments`
- **Statistics**: `/wp-json/ham/v1/stats/*`

### Frontend Integration
1. **Obtain JWT Token**: Use the authentication endpoint to obtain a JWT token.
2. **Include Token in Requests**: Include the token in the Authorization header for subsequent requests.
3. **Access Data**: Access data using appropriate endpoints based on user permissions.

## FAQ
### Does this plugin handle frontend rendering?
No, this plugin is designed as a backend for a headless WordPress site. It provides API endpoints that can be consumed by a frontend application (like Next.js).

### How is authentication handled?
Authentication uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens). Users authenticate with username/password to get a token, which is then included in subsequent API requests.

### Can I extend the plugin with custom roles or data types?
Yaa, the plugin is built to be extensible. You can add custom roles or modify data structures by extending the plugin's classes or using WordPress hooks.

### Is the plugin GDPR compliant?
The plugin stores only the data necessary for its functionality. Personal data handling should comply with your organization's GDPR policies.
